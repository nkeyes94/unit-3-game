-Create an array with words to randomly be used to guess
    -var wordArray = [a, b, c,...z]
-Create a function to randomly select a word from the array
    -Math.floor(Math.random()*(1, wordArray.length))
-Record keystrokes from the player
-Display the random word as underscores _ _ _ _
-Create a guess remaining tracker
    -guess remaining should perhaps be randomWord.length + 3.
    -The +3 will give the user extra guesses while keeping the game dynamic
    -Display the guess remaining
-If a letter is in the random word, display it
    -Perhaps a for loop or index checking
    -for(var i = 0; i < randomWord.length; i++){
        if(randomGuess === randomWord.charAt(i){
            display letter;
        })
        else{
            record guessed word;
            guess remaining - 1  
        }
    }
    -randomGuess.indexOf(randomWord) perhaps?
